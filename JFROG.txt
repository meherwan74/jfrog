JFrog 
JFrog is used store the artifacts.
Why you need to store the artifact means if you want to change anything in the code we need to write the entire code. If you save the artifact it will be easy to edit the code. So that purpose we use jfrog to store the artifact.
We use public repositories like jfrog, nexus, also we internal storages.
Create a jfog server 
Jfrog pre requisite is min 4gb ram and 16gb of hard disk and java.
Open browser fgrog artifactory oss jfrog.com
Open server

# yum install -y java-1.8.0*
# java -version 
# yum install wget
Oprn browser goto jfrog pagelinux installation tar.gz
# wget (jfrog link)
# lshttps://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/bintray-artifactory/org/artifactory/oss/jfrog-artifactory-oss/[RELEASE]/jfrog-artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]-linux.tar.gz
# tar -xvf (tra file)
# ls
# cd (dir)
# ls
#  cd app 
# ls 
# cd bin
# ls
# /.artifactory.sh
